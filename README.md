This project was started on July 13th, 2025.
The goal of this project is to create a Redis server from scratch. 
This project is a network server that uses TCP and handles peer connections through asynchronous I/O utilizing event loops.
The underlying data storage uses a key-value database. To minimize latency during database resizing, a custom database implementing progressive hashing was constructed.
More information will be added as the scope of the project becomes clear.
